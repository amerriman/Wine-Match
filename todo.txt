*Logout button shown only if logged in??



req.session.passport.user

req.user should work too

* Make an about page

* Can there be a different heading if it's a logged in user and if there isn't?  I think yes...

* figure out the damn rating thing.

** pull the images out into a different file and then load them? Will that work?  Or pull ALL of the info into a new file so it all stays together?
